3 page website with information on different Toyota Corolla trims. The index.html is the homepage, trims.html is where all the information on the different trims are and contact.html is where "customers" would go to send inquries to the company. about.html is a webpage with no content. 

All files are linked to the one styles.cc file.
All images are in the Images folder.
All videos/audio that are not from YouTube are in the Media folder.

The questions.txt file is where I answered all the questions that were required to be answered.
